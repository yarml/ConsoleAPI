# Console API
A multiplatform(Windows, Linux) library to make interactive console apps.

This library was made for a final class project in which we were not allowed
to use external libraries, so instead, we made out own.

Documentation for the behavior of the API, and some overview about the
implementation of both the Linux and Widnows libraries can be found at
[docs/console_api.md](docs/console_api.md)
